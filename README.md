 Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset : 
Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are crucial initial steps in any data-driven project. By thoroughly examining and preparing the dataset, we can uncover meaningful insights that aid in understanding trends, patterns, and relationships within the data. This comprehensive analysis not only enhances our understanding of the Titanic dataset but also serves as a foundation for making informed decisions in subsequent analytical processes.

Dataset : 
The Titanic dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including demographics, ticket details, and survival status. It is an ideal dataset for exploring factors that influenced survival during the tragic sinking.

Methodology:
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
The first step involves loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis. Initial exploration includes examining the structure of the dataset and displaying a snapshot of the first few rows to understand its contents.


2. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is essential to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis:


a. Handling Missing Values: Identify and address missing data in key variables such as age, cabin, and embarked port.


b. Data Formatting: Standardize data formats across columns for consistency and ease of analysis.

c. Handling Outliers: Evaluate and manage outliers that may skew statistical analysis and visualizations.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves exploring the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between variables:

a. Descriptive Statistics: Compute summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical features like age, fare, and family size.

b. Visualization: Utilize visualizations like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize distributions and relationships between variables such as survival rates across different passenger classes, age groups, and gender.


Conclusion
Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset provide valuable insights into the factors influencing survival during the disaster.
By systematically cleaning the data and conducting comprehensive EDA, we uncover patterns and relationships that inform subsequent analytical processes and decision-making.
